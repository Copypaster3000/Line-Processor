**Line Processor**
The purpose of this project was to gain experience in C programming language, particularly with arrays and outputting text to the terminal. Given lines from a file or input from a user the program outputs which lines are over 20 chars, the total number of lines, the longest line, and the shortest line. The output format for this project was given ahead of time so the challenge was to be able to take any text file or user input and output information about it in the exact correct format.

The output is in this particular format:  
*Warning* Line 2 is truncated.  
*Warning* Line 5 is truncated.  
Total number of lines: 5  
The longest is Line 2: "This line will be tr" (len=20)  
The shortest is Line 4: "shortest" (len=8)
